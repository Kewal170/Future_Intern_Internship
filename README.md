## Project Overview
This repository contains my submissions for various tasks completed during my internship at **Future Intern**. The projects demonstrate my proficiency in Java programming and include a calculator application, a number guessing game, a password generator, and a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Calculator Application and Number Guessing Game
1. **CalculatorApp.java**
   - **Description**: A console-based application that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user can input numbers and select the desired operation, making it a practical tool for simple calculations.
   - **Features**:
     - Supports basic arithmetic operations.
     - Handles user input and provides clear instructions.

2. **NumberGuess.java**
   - **Description**: A simple game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The application gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, enhancing user engagement.
   - **Features**:
     - Random number generation.
     - User input validation.
     - Feedback on user guesses.

### Task 2: Password Generator
1. **PasswordGenerator.java**
   - **Description**: This tool generates strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and inclusion of special characters and numbers. It aims to improve security by creating unique passwords.
   - **Features**:
     - Customizable password length.
     - Options to include/exclude special characters and numbers.
     - Generates secure passwords.

### Task 3: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
1. **RockPaperScissorsGame.java**
   - **Description**: A console-based game that allows users to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The program features input validation, modular code structure, and clear user instructions.
   - **Features**:
     - Input validation for user choices.
     - Displays the computer's choice.
     - Determines and announces the winner.

## How to Run the Projects
